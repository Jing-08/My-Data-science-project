This is code part of my project. 

The title of my paper is Optical Recognition and correction of Historical Newspaper Text. 

The paper contains the performance of Tesseract on the Chronicling America historical newspaper dataset, 
the character-level errors produced by Tesseract, 
and a comparison of the effectiveness of three spelling correction methods (Levenshtein distance, SpellChecker and N-gram) on OCR-generated text.
